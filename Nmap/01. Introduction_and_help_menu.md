## [Introduction]

- It is crucial that we begin any attack with a port scan and  Nmap can be used to perform many different kinds of port scan.
- Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports:

1. **Well-Known Ports (0-1023):**
    - Reserved for system services and commonly used protocols. Examples include HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), and SSH (22).
2. **Registered Ports (1024-49151):**
    - Assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for specific applications or services. They are typically used by applications that aren't as universal as well-known ports. Examples include MySQL (3306) and HTTP Proxy (8080).
3. **Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-65535):**
    - Also known as ephemeral ports. They are used for dynamic, private, or temporary purposes. Many operating systems use these ports for client-side application communication.

⇒ Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall)

1) What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?

Result: ports

2) How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?

Result: 65535

3) How many of these are considered "well-known"? 

Result: 1024

## [Nmap Switches]

Open help menu for nmap (accessed with `nmap -h`) and/or the nmap man page (access with `man nmap`).

```
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ nmap -h                
Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org )
Usage: nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}
....
```

1) What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?

```
SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
```

Result: -sS

2) Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?

```
SCAN TECHNIQUES:
.....
  -sU: UDP Scan
```

Result: -sU

3) If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?

```
OS DETECTION:
  -O: Enable OS detection
```

Result: -O

4) Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?

```
SERVICE/VERSION DETECTION:
  -sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
```

Result: -sV

5) The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?

```
OUTPUT:
.....
  -v: Increase verbosity level (use -vv or more for greater effect)
```

Result: -v

6) Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?

Result: -vv

**[saving the output of scans]** If we save the output of our scans, we will only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection).

7) What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?

```
  -oA <basename>: Output in the three major formats at once
```

Result: -oA

8) What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?

```
-oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file>: Output scan in normal, XML, s|<rIpt kIddi3,
     and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename.
```

Result: -oN

9) A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?

```
 -oN/-oX/-oS/-oG <file>: Output scan in normal, XML, s|<rIpt kIddi3,
     and Grepable format, respectively, to the given filename.
```

Result: -oG 

**[Aggressive mode]** This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.

10) How would you activate this setting?

```
  -A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
```

Result: -A

11) How would you set the timing template to level 5?

```
  -T<0-5>: Set timing template (higher is faster)
```

Result: 

**[specific port to scan]**

11) How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?

```
 -p <port ranges>: Only scan specified ports
    Ex: -p22; -p1-65535; -p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080,S:9
```

Result: -p 80

12) How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?

Result: -p 1000-1500

**[Useful options]**

13) How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?

Result: -p-

14) How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?

```
SCRIPT SCAN:
  -sC: equivalent to --script=default
  --script=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts> is a comma separated list of
           directories, script-files or script-categories
```

Result: --script

15) How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category?

Result:  --script=vuln
