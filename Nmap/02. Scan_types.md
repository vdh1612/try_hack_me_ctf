### [TCP Connect Scans (-sT)]

- It’s important that you know TCP three-way handshake:

- a TCP Connect scan works by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives.
- if Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set ⇒ Nmap knows that the port is closed.

    [?] What if the port is open, but hidden behind a firewall?
    
    - Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. ⇒ the port is being protected and filtered by a firewall
    - it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux: `iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset`
    
    Which RFC defines the appropriate behaviour for the TCP protocol?
    
    Result: RFC 9293
    
    If a port is closed, which flag should the server send back to indicate this?
    
    Result: RST
    

### [**SYN "Half-open" Scans or "Stealth" scans (-sS)**]

- SYN scans (-sS) are used to scan the TCP port-range of a target. However, it works slightly different from TCP scan.
- Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server.

- Advantages of SYN scan:
    - It can be used to bypass older IDS as they are looking out for a full three way handshake. However, it’s no longer the case with modern IDS solutions; ⇒ reason why this is called “stealth” scans.
    - SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as only full connection for TCP 3-way handshake is logged. ⇒ “stealth” scan
    - YN scans are significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan
- Disadvantages:
    - sudo permissions is required in linux
- SYN scan to identify closed and filtered ports, the exact same rules as with a TCP scan

There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they?

Result: Half-open,Stealth

Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)?

Result: N

### [UDP Scans (-sU)]

- Unlike TCP, UDP connections are stateless ⇒ rely on speed of internet but much slower to scan
- When a packet is sent, there should be no response - if this happens then Nmap refers to the port as being **open|filtered** (it could be firewalled).
- If it gets a UDP response (unusual), then the port is market as **open**
- When a packet is sent to a **closed** UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable.
- Since UDP scans are slow, the 20 most common ports are scanned: `nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>`

If a UDP port doesn't respond to an Nmap scan, what will it be marked as?

Result: open|filtered

When a UDP port is closed, by convention the target should send back a "port unreachable" message. Which protocol would it use to do so?

Result: ICMP

### [NULL, FIN and Xmas]

- NULL, FIN and Xmas TCP port scans are less commonly used
- NULL scans (-sN) are when the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all. As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.
- FIN scans (-sF) work alike. however, instead of sending a completely empty packet, a request is sent with the FIN flag (finish connection flag)
- Xmas scans (-sX) send a malformed TCP packet and expects a RST response for closed ports. It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN)
- The expected response for open ports with these scans is also identical, and is very similar to that of a UDP scan. These scans will only ever identify ports as being `open|filtered`, `closed`, or `filtered`.
- Microsoft Windows (and a lot of Cisco network devices) are known to respond with a `RST` to any **malformed TCP packet** -- regardless of whether the port is actually open or not. This results in **all ports** showing up as being **closed**.
- The goal here is **firewall evasion**. Many firewalls are configured to drop incoming TCP packets to blocked ports which have the SYN flag set (thus blocking new connection initiation requests). Sending requests which do not contain the SYN flag can bypass firewall.

Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag?

Result: Xmas

Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?

Result: firewall evasion

Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?

Result: Microsoft Windows

### [ICMP Network Scanning]

- This scan is used which IP addresses contain active hosts, and which do not.
- Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network.
- we use the -sn switch in conjunction with IP ranges which can be specified with either a hypen (-) or CIDR notation (/24 or /16):`nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254` or `nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24`
- The -sn switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets (or ARP requests on a local network, if run with sudo or directly as the root user) to identify targets

How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation)
Result: nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16
