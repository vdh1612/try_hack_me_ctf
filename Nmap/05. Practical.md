1) Does the target ip respond to ICMP echo (ping) requests (Y/N)?

Result: N

```

2) Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered?

Result: 999

3) There is a reason given for this -- what is it?

Result: no response

4) Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open?

Result: 5
